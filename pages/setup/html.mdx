# Set Up 

## Setting up RGE.js using HTML/JS
This page walks you through installing, configuring, and running your RGE.js environment using HTML and JS.

## File Structure
Recommended file structure:
<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="public" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.File name="index.html" />
    <FileTree.Folder name="javascript" defaultOpen>
        <FileTree.File name="script.js" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

## Install
Paste this into your HTML file's `body`:
```html copy filename="index.html"
<canvas id="gameCanvas" width="1350" height="720"></canvas>

<script type="module">
    import * as rgejs from "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/rge.js@latest/index.js"
    window.rgejs = rgejs;
</script>

<!-- Link your script.js file -->
<script type="module" src="./script.js"></script>
```
Great! Now RGE.js has been installed via the `cdn` and is added to the global `window` object. Let's now take a look at instantiating RGE.js.

## Instantiating RGE.js
In order to instantiate RGE.js, we have to go to our `script.js` file.

```javascript copy filename="javascript/script.js"
// Creating a shorthand for rgejs
const r = rgejs;

// Takes the canvas ID and expected FPS.
const rge = new r.Engine('gameCanvas', 60);

rge.start();
```

Great job! You have now installed and instantiated RGE.js.

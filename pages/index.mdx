## What is RGE.js?
RGE.js is a Javascript library for **simple and intuitive game development** and digital art. It enhances your game development and prototyping workflow, and allows you to create, curate, and publish games to the web, all while keeping the best practices in mind.

In a matter of seconds, RGE.js sets up a working canvas environment and does all of the heavy lifting for you. While traditionally using the HTML5 canvas is exhausting, full of boilerplate, and frusterating, RGE.js provides a high-level interface and set of utilities which allows you to interact with the canvas, and more!

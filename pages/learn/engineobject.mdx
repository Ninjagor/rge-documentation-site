# The Engine Object

This is a brief overview of only the most used and vital parts of the `Engine` object. For a more in-depth overview, look [here](/).

    This tutorial assumes that you have a basic understanding of object oriented programming.
</Callout>

## Creating the Engine object
The Engine object is one of the most important objects, and provides an interface to perform nearly all of your project's logic related actions. Instantiating the engine is rather simple.

```javascript copy 
// First parameter is ID of the canvas
// Second parameter is target FPS
const rge = new r.Engine('gameCanvas', 60)
```

## Basic Utilities
The `Engine` object provides a vast amount of utilities which you can use in order to make your project function. Let's take a look at some of the most used ones.

### `start()`
#### Code Snippet
```javascript copy 
// Goes at EOF
rge.start()
```
#### Use Case
`start()` initiates the rendering of entities, as well as attaching event detectors (such as onClick, onKeyPress, collision, etc) to the rendered entities.

  Component unmounting and remounting in React can cause hydration errors if not handled correctly.
</Callout>

### `stop()`
#### Code Snippet
```javascript copy 
rge.stop()
```
Using with React/NextJS to handle hydration errors caused by the component dismounting:
```jsx copy
useEffect(() => {
    const rge = new r.Engine('gameCanvas', 60);
    rge.start();

    return () => {
        rge.stop();
    }
}, []);
```

#### Use Case
`stop()` deletes all entities and event detectors from the canvas, and detaches itself. It can be used for a variety of reasons. The two main reasons are: 
- If you want to detach one `Engine` instance from the canvas, and attach a different one
- You are handling component lifecycles (with react) to make sure that hydration errors do not occur.

  `stop()` can be used in the return statement of `useEffect` to prevent hydration errors! 
</Callout>

### `addEntity()`


#### Code Snippet 
```javascript copy 
rge.addEntity(entity)
```

#### Use Case
Registers an entity to an array. When `start()` is called, it cycles through each entity every refresh, and paints them to the canvas.

### `destroyEntity()`

#### Code Snippet 
```javascript copy 
rge.destroyEntity(entity)
```

#### Use Case
Deletes the entity from the entity array, so it is no longer rendered. Also set's a value inside the entity to `destroyed` so it no longer looks for collisions.

### `configure()`

#### Code Snippet 
```javascript copy 
function preload() {

}

function tick() {

}

rge.configure({
  tick: tick,
  preload: preload,
  centeredOrigin: true | false
})
```

#### Use Case
`configure()` is used to set a function to be the preload and tick functions.

### More Utilities
The utilities mentioned above are only the few most commonly used ones. There are a huge plethora of utilities provided by the RGE.js engine. You can read more about them [here](/)
